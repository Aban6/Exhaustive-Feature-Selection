# Exhaustive-Search-Wrapper-Feature-Selection
## Python-Exhaustive search
The Exhausive Feature Selection (EFS) method searches across all possible feature combinations. Its aim is to find the best performing feature subset—we can say it’s a brute-force evaluation of feature subsets. It creates all the subsets of features from 1 to N, with N being the total number of features, and for each subset, it builds a machine learning algorithm and selects the subset with the best performance (as.tamu.edu/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.tamu.edu%2Fidp%2FAuthn%2FRemoteUser%3Fconversation%3De1s1).
