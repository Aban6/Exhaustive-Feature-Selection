# Exhaustive-Search-Wrapper-Feature-Selection
## Python-Exhaustive search
The Exhausive Feature Selection (EFS) method searches across all possible feature combinations. Its aim is to find the best performing feature subset—we can say it’s a brute-force evaluation of feature subsets. It creates all the subsets of features from 1 to N, with N being the total number of features, and for each subset, it builds a machine learning algorithm and selects the subset with the best performance (https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/hands-on-with-feature-selection-techniques-wrapper-methods-5bb6d99b1274).
